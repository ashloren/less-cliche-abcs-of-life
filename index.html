<br>
<p><span>B</span> is for <span class="word"><a class="hvr-underline-from-left" href="#">Beauty</a></span>. <br>You possess a variable amount of two different types of beauty: <a class="hvr-rectangle-in" href="#">inner</a> & <a class="hvr-rectangle-out" href="#">outer</a>. <br><br>Your inner beauty can last throughout life, if you work to keep it intact. <br><br>Your outer beauty, however, will eventually fade. <br><br>It is yours on lease, with no option to buy.</p>
<br>
<p><span>C</span> is for <span class="word"></span>.</p>
<br>
<p><span>D</span> is for <span class="word"><a class="hvr-underline-from-left" href="#">Dogs</a></span>. <br>They are the best friends we DO NOT deserve.</p>

<p><span>E</span> is for </p>
</section>
<br>
<p><span>F</span> is for <span class="word"><a class="hvr-underline-from-left" href="#">Freedom</a></span>.<br>Perhaps the single most valuable commodity in life.<br><br>The most commonly held belief is that this award goes to Time. <br><br>Of course, we each have a finite amount of time to be alive.<br><br>But, what if that were not the case?<br><br>Does immortality seem desirable in the absence of freedom?<br><br>Ultimately, freedom = possibilities.</p>
<br>
<p><span>G</span> is for <span class="word"></span></p>
<br>
<p><span>H</span> is for <span class="word"><a class="hvr-underline-from-left" href="#">Hatred</a></span>. <br>An intense, all-consuming aversion to someone or something.   <br><br> It forms an endpoint on the spectrum of human emotion. <br><br>You can think of it like the top of the food pyramid. <br><br>As with sugar, butter & salt: do your best to use sparingly.</p>
<br>
<p><span>I</span> is for <span class="word"></span>.</p>
<br>
<p><span>J</span> is for "<span class="word"><a class="hvr-underline-from-left" href="#">Jack-of-all-Trades Syndrome</a></span>." <br>Long-term lack of specialization. <br><br>A phrase I made up, used to describe a person like myself who has never (and still probably doesn't) really know what they want to do with their lives. <br><br>People suffering from this condition often make it all the way through life without declaring a Major (much to their disadvantage, in most cases).<br><br>The result?<br><br>Earning a degree in, well...nothing. </p>
<br>
<p><span>K</span> is for <span class="word"><a class="hvr-underline-from-left" href="#">Knowledge</a></span>. <br>All things which are known by an individual. <br><br>Clustered information in our minds that amount to our skills and abilities. <br><br>The human brain is estimated to have a data storage capacity of around 2.5 petabytes, although we have no reliable method for calculating the sizes of the memories stored within them. <br><br>Thankfully, our disc is rewritable.</p>

<p><span>N</span> is for <span class="word"><a class="hvr-underline-from-left" href="#">Nostalgia</a></span>. <br>Involuntary time travel.<br><br>Activated by anything familiar that has been inextricably associated with your memories of the past. <br><br>Depending on the trigger, you may travel back to: an entire era of your life, a significant event within it, or (at its most granular) a specific interaction. <br><br>Reliably produces strong feelings of sentimentality. <br><br>Ends abruptly and often causes intense yearning to remain in the memory.</p>
<br>
<p><span>O</span> is for <span class="word"><a class="hvr-underline-from-left" href="#">Orgasm</a></span>. <br>A crescendo of physical pleasure brought about by genital stimulation. <br><br>At first, they are a gift you will mostly be giving to yourself. <br><br>Later on and with some luck, others will start giving you some too. <br><br>Do NOT be a greedy hoarder of orgasms! <br><br>Giving them is *almost* as fun as receiving.</p>
